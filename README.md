# MediMinutes

## Inspiration
The prospect of creating an educational platform for medical professionals that is not only accessible but also high quality was a great inspiration to our team.

As computer science students, we understand the importance of keeping on top of a constantly changing and evolving field. Accessible learning is also an issue our team holds in high regard as some of us are from first-generation immigrant families and faced significant barriers ourselves being the first members of our families to attend post-secondary.

## What it does
MediMinutes is a medical education application that allows users to take lessons on over 200 topics ranging from infectious diseases to environmental health.

## How we built it
We used the following technologies to build MediMinutes:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, JavaScript, Tailwind-CSS
- **Backend**: Python for scripting and data processing
- **Design**: Figma for UI/UX design
- **Database**: Firebase for data storage
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's generative text API for quiz questions

### Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Created Python scripts to scrape sites for medical data and stored it in Firebase.
2. **AI Integration**: Used OpenAI's API to generate quiz questions specific to each topic.
3. **Frontend Development**: Developed the web application using Next.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind-CSS.
4. **Design**: Created a complete wireframe in Figma and implemented it.
5. **Integration**: Connected all components and ensured seamless functionality.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Time Constraints**: Limited time required prioritizing core features and streamlining the platform.
- **Balancing Creativity and Feasibility**: Had to manage the inclusion of creative ideas within the project timeline.
- **Technical Challenges**: Faced issues with finding reliable APIs, which we overcame by web scraping data from the World Health Organization.
- **Coding and Design Issues**: Solved problems related to coding, design layouts, and user experience optimization on the fly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Automated web-scraping script to collect data for lessons
- Integration of AI tools to generate question banks
- Original hand-designed art sprites, logo, and mascot Frankie the frog

## What we learned
- Importance of collaboration and effective communication within a team
- Technical skills in web scraping, AI integration, and frontend/backend development
- Design principles and user experience optimization

## What's next for MediMinutes
- **Mobile Application Support**: Developing a mobile version of MediMinutes.
- **New Lesson Series**: Adding lessons specifically focusing on pharmaceutical drugs.
- **Larger Courses**: Collaborating with medical professionals to offer more comprehensive courses.

### Future Plans:
- Expanding beyond medical topics to other STEM fields.
- Fostering connections and collaboration within the STEM ecosystem.
- Exploring partnerships with educational institutions, organizations, and industry leaders.
- Continually updating the platform with new contributions from health professionals.

We believe it is important to foster connections and collaboration within the STEM ecosystem. To that end, we will explore partnerships with educational institutions, organizations, and industry leaders to amplify the impact of our platform and create opportunities for mentorship, networking, and professional development.

By providing a dynamic and evolving platform, we hope to inspire future generations and foster a deeper appreciation for medicine and innovation.
